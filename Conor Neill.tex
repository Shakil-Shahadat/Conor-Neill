\section{ [ 13 December, 2024 ] \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dC5g7wgxOA}{On Taking Intelligent Action... and Improving your Intuition} }


Last week's video was, life rewards action more than intelligence. And that video has been one of my most successful videos of the last few years in terms of the engagement and the number of viewers watching it on YouTube, on LinkedIn. And this is just a moment to comment on some of the questions, the comments that have come in from that video. \\

I think many of the comments were extremely positive saying, absolutely Conor, I needed to hear this. This is so true. For many years, I stayed in my intelligence and waited for the world to discover me and I discovered that only action begins the change. \\
