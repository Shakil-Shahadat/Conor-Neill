\section{ [ 13 December, 2024 ] \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dC5g7wgxOA}{On Taking Intelligent Action... and Improving your Intuition} }


Last week's video was, life rewards action more than intelligence. And that video has been one of my most successful videos of the last few years in terms of the engagement and the number of viewers watching it on YouTube, on LinkedIn. And this is just a moment to comment on some of the questions, the comments that have come in from that video. \\

I think many of the comments were extremely positive saying, absolutely Conor, I needed to hear this. This is so true. For many years, I stayed in my intelligence and waited for the world to discover me and I discovered that only action begins the change. \\
 
But there were quite a number of comments that said, well, dumb action, isn't dumb action worse than any action at all? And I think, the answer is absolutely yes. Dumb action is probably worse than no action at all. \\

But I would say, the watchers of these videos, the community that comes to my channel on YouTube or watches these videos on LinkedIn, the likelihood is, you're intelligent enough to not take dumb action. Or at the very least if you did take dumb action to see it very quickly and readjust and change the direction of your action. \\

So, for each of you, the worry is definitely not taking dumb action. For each of you, \hl{the biggest barrier is taking the good ideas that you have and turning them into the first action that makes an impact.} And I think there's two reflections that I wanted to share with you just on this idea of taking better action. \\

So, clearly, \hl{taking any action is better than never taking any action.} But once you start to take action and be systematic about daily making progress on taking actions, now, you do need to tune your intuition to take better decisions and where you focus your time for the greatest impact. \\

And for me, there's a book by Peter Drucker called `Managing Oneself' that makes a recommendation that I see so few people do. And his recommendation is, \hl{you get a journal and when you take a decision, at the time you take the decision, you write down why you took the decision and what you predict is going to happen.} You write down your prediction and it might be a prediction a month out, a prediction a year out, a prediction five years out. But in each time you take an important action or you take an important decision, he recommends you stop and you write down why you took it and what you think is going to happen. And then 3 months later, a year later, when the time comes to look at your prediction, you force yourself to look at what you expected was going to happen and what actually happened. \\

And Peter Drucker says, \hl{the only way you're going to improve your intuition is through this process of being forcing yourself to write down your prediction and then forcing yourself to look at whether your prediction and what really happens are the same.} \\
